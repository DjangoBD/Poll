    <p>
        Online Polling app is a django powered polling application. With a admin panel, site administrator
        can able to add any numbers of poll and corresponding multiple choice for the selected post.
        From the front end, user can vote for a poll by selecting one choice answer. This is my 'warmup' app
        written with django .
